# Cat_Classification
Implementations of functions required to build a 2-layer neural network and an L-layer deep neural network for image classification; then compare their respective performances.<br>
The L-layer deep neural network model is fully capable of classifying Cat Images. No predefined deep learning python module is used in this model. It is built on Numpy only.
