# Social Distancing
This is a project on object detection. Here we detected humans in the video using Haar Cascade Classifiers. Whenever two or more people came in close contact, a red line is shown to indicate that they are in close perimeter and a beep sound is generated.

# Requirements
Python modules: OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib, threading, winsound <br>
Haar Cascade Classifier
